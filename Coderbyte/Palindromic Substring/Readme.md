Palindromic Substring <!----> <!----> <!----> <!---->

Have the function PalindromicSubstring(**str**) take the **str** parameter being passed and find

the longest palindromic substring, which means the longest substring which is read the same forwards as it is backwards. For example: if **str** is "abracecars" then your program should return the string **racecar** because it is the longest palindrome within the input string.

The input will only contain lowercase alphabetic characters. The longest palindromic substring will always be unique, but if there is none that is longer than 2 characters, return the string **none**.

<section>
                Input: "hellosannasmith"

                Output: sannas <!----></section> <section>
                Input: "abcdefgg"

                Output: none
